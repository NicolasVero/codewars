// The four bases found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).

// In genetics, GC-content is the percentage of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) bases on a DNA molecule that are either guanine or cytosine.

// Given a DNA sequence (a string) return the GC-content in percent, rounded up to 2 decimal digits for Python, not rounded in all other languages.

// For more information about GC-content you can take a look to wikipedia GC-content.

// For example: the GC-content of the following DNA sequence is 50%: "AAATTTCCCGGG".


function gcContent(dna) {
    if (!dna) {
        return 0;
    }
  
    const gcCount = [...dna].filter(base => base === 'G' || base === 'C').length;
    return (gcCount / dna.length) * 100;
}
